## About
W2MHS is an open source toolbox designed for detecting and quantifying White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) in Alzheimer’s and aging-related neurological disorders. WMHs arise as bright regions on T2- weighted FLAIR images. They reflect comorbid neural injury or cerebral vascular disease burden. Their precise detection is of interest in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with regard to its prognosis. Our toolbox provides a self-sufficient set of tools for segmenting these WMHs reliably and further quantifying their burden for down-processing studies. This documentation provides the background on the algorithm and parameters that comprise W2MHS along with the syntax.

This wiki provides installation and configuration instructions for GUI users of the toolbox. If you want to know more details about the project, source code, and Matlab command prompt interface or contribute to the development of the toolbox, please refer to [W2MHS](https://github.com/SichaoYang/W2MHS).
